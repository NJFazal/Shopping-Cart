        <h1>Shopping Cart</h1>
        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#10024;</span>Description:</h2>
        <p>This was a fun exercise in intergrating back end and front end through an API.</p>
        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#128187;</span>How To Run:</h2>
        <p>Simply open the HTML file in a local host and see that you can click on the different items to add them to your cart. You can also click on the items that you added to see where they came from and their cost. By clicking on that area, you can also delete them from your list. You can also restock the items from the restock button.</p>
        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#128679;</span>Roadmap to Future Improvements:</h2>
        <p>This is very simplistic. I would like to add functionality to the check out and I would like to make this look a lot prettier but it works for what I want it to do for now.</p>
